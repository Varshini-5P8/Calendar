This project is a simple calendar made in C.
A calendar is a system of organizing days.
This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months and years. 
A date is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system. 
A calendar is also a physical record of such a system. 
A calendar can also mean a list of planned events, such as a court calendar or a partly or fully chronological list of documents, such as a calendar of wills.
The term calendar is taken from calendae, the term for the first day of the month in the Roman calendar, related to the verb calare 'to call out', referring to the "calling" of the new moon when it was first seen.
Latin calendarium meant 'account book, register'. 
The Latin term was adopted in Old French as calendier and from there in Middle English as calender by the 13th century.
In an year we have 365 days except for leap years we have 366 days.
